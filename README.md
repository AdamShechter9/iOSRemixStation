# iOSRemixStation

Project I created during a hackathon at Coding Dojo, San Jose, CA.
It lets you "remix" songs on the fly.
Offers a pitch-shifter, speed change, low pass and high pass filters, and delay/reverb effects.

We have accelerometer features added to control 2 parameters at once.

feel free to clone / fork and pull requests.

I'd be looking for a way to add visualization in the future,
and to add more features.
